# AirBnB_clone
Project

The AirBnB clone project is a web application that mimics the AirBnB website.
The application will comprise:
1. command interpreter
2. A website
3. Storage mechanism ie database or file
4. An API that offers an interface between data and the front-end

Command Interpreter
This is similar to the Shell but restricted to a single use-case.
In the project the command interpreter will be used to manage objects.
For instance
1. Creating a new object,
2. Retrieving an object from storage,
3. Perform operations on the objects,
4. Update object attributes, and
5. Destroy an object
